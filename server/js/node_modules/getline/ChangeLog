Version 1.0.2 (16th November 2011)
-------------

	Avoid lengthy call stack from recursive next() calls on
	GetlineAsync objects where the lines read are very short.

Version 1.0.1 (13th November 2011)
-------------

	Automatically disconnect listeners from GetlineAsync's inherited
	EventEmitter object once end-of-file or an error has occurred, or
	close() has been called.

	Where an error is propagated as a "line" emission because the
	next() method of GetlineAsync has been called by the user
	incorrectly outside the "line" event callback, fix the bug that
	also caused a property of a null buffer object to be accessed.

	Add a LICENSE file.

Version 1.0.0 (10th November 2011)
-------------

	Close the file descriptor and release the buffer once end-of-file
	has been reached or an error has occurred, and provide an explicit
	close() method for a deterministic close in other cases.

Version 0.0.2 (9th November 2011)
-------------

	Cater for DOS style line endings ('\r\n').

	Provide an explicit error object for the "line" callback if the
	next() method of GetlineAsync is called while a read operation is
	already taking place.

	Improve error message from GetlineSync if a file cannot be opened
	for reading.

	Revise demo script.

	Add this ChangeLog

Version 0.0.1 (7th November 2011)
-------------

	Initial release.
